# montyman
Monte Carlo Tree Search bot to play Nine Men's Morris as implemented by my repo [nineman](https://github.com/UsAndRufus/nineman).

It's currently pretty bad and almost certainly very buggy. The code is a complete mess because I did it in a rush for a self-imposed deadline.

# Usage
Use the v0.1.0 release with v0.2.1 of nineman.
